# Power Configurations for WhatsMiner Devices

`powers` - This directory contains bin configuration files related to the power settings of various MicroBT's WhatsMiner devices.

## Files

- `M3X.csv` - Contains bin power configurations for M3X series models like M30S/+/++, M31S/+/++, etc.
- `M5X.csv` - Contains bin power configurations for M5X series models like M50S/+/++, M56S/+/++, etc.
- `M6X.csv` - Contains bin power configurations for M6X series models like M60S/+/++, M66S/+/++, etc.

## Configuration Table Descriptions

| Field             | Description                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `freq`            | Operating frequency of the miner (MHz)                       |
| `voltage_target`  | Target operating voltage for the miner (mV)                  |
| `voltage_limit`   | Maximum allowable voltage for the miner (mV)                 |
| `chip_temp`       | Maximum temperature limit for the chips (째C)                 |
| `board_temp`      | Maximum temperature limit for the boards (째C)                |
| `ok_core_pct`     | Percentage of cores that must pass the test for operation    |
| `min_power`       | Minimum power consumption during operation (Watts)           |

## Examples of Configuration Entries

Each entry in the configuration files provides detailed settings applicable to specific models or bins within models.
